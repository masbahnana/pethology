        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Imprinting is a form of rapid learning that occurs during a critical period in early development, often involving attachment to parents."

        question: "What type of learning involves trial and error with rewards and punishments?",
        options: ["Classical conditioning", "Habituation", "Operant conditioning", "Latent learning"],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Operant conditioning involves learning through consequences, where behaviours are strengthened or weakened by rewards and punishments."

    {
        question: "What is 'habituation'?",
        options: ["Learning a new behaviour", "Decrease in response to repeated harmless stimulus", "Increase in aggressive behaviour", "Formation of new habits"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Habituation is a simple form of learning where an animal decreases its response to a repeated, harmless stimulus."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the 'critical period' in animal development?",
        options: ["Time when animals are most aggressive", "Limited time window for certain learning", "Period of hibernation", "Time of sexual maturity"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The critical period is a limited time window during development when certain types of learning (like imprinting) must occur."
    },
    {
        question: "What is 'displacement behaviour'?",
        options: ["Moving to a new territory", "Behaviour performed in the wrong context due to conflict", "Replacing one animal with another", "Migratory behaviour"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Displacement behaviour occurs when an animal performs an apparently irrelevant behaviour during a conflict situation."

    {
        question: "What does 'agonistic behaviour' refer to?",
        options: ["Playful behaviour", "Behaviour related to conflict and aggression", "Mating behaviour", "Feeding behaviour"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Agonistic behaviour encompasses all behaviours related to conflict, including aggression, submission, and avoidance."

    {
        question: "What is 'social hierarchy' in animals?",
        options: ["Random social interactions", "Ranking system determining access to resources", "Family tree", "Migration patterns"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Social hierarchy is a ranking system within a group that determines access to resources, mates, and social interactions."

        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Play behaviour allows young animals to practice and develop skills they will need as adults, such as hunting, fighting, and social interaction."
    },
    {
        question: "What is 'stereotypic behaviour'?",
        options: ["Normal natural behaviour", "Repetitive, apparently functionless behaviour", "Mating ritual", "Communication signal"],
