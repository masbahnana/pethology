        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "An animal can use its skin to maintain its internal body temperature when it is cold by vasoconstriction. This process involves the narrowing of blood vessels in the skin, reducing blood flow to the surface and conserving heat. Shivering is a muscle response that generates heat, but vasoconstriction is the primary mechanism for temperature regulation.",
